## Spurious Correlations

&nbsp;

If you look long enough you'll find correlations all over! A spurious correlation is a correlation that happens from 
chance alone, and these correlations are one of the reasons scientists use statistics with confidence levels (p-values 
or confidence intervals) and/or limit their searching to theoretically grounded effects (e.g. pre-registration of 
hypotheses).

The <a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">spurious correlations</a> website lists a number of 
correlations which exist but seem unlikely to be causally related to one another. Do you see any in this list which you 
think are not spurious, and may have a causal relationship? Discuss in the forums, and provide links as appropriate.
